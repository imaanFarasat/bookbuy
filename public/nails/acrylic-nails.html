                                <p class="content-text">While both acrylic and gel nails offer enhancements, they differ in application and durability. Acrylics tend to be more durable and less expensive, while gels are known for their more natural look and faster curing time.  Consider your lifestyle and desired look when choosing between the two.</p>
                                <p class="content-text">Acrylics require mixing a liquid monomer and powder polymer, while gels are cured under UV or LED light. Gels are generally considered more flexible, while acrylics provide a harder, more robust finish.</p>
