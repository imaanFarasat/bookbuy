                                    <p class="content-text">For those who love a touch of sparkle, adding glitter accents to light pink nails is a glamorous option. A subtle dusting of glitter on the tips or as an accent nail elevates the look without being overwhelming.</p>
                                    <p class="content-text">Experiment with different glitter sizes and colors, such as silver, gold, or iridescent, to create a dazzling effect that complements the soft pink backdrop.</p>
                                    <ul class="content-bullets">
                                        <li>Apply a thin coat of glitter polish to the desired area.</li>
                                        <li>Use a fine brush for precise glitter placement.</li>
                                        <li>Seal the glitter with a top coat to prevent chipping.</li>

                                    <h3 class="content-subtitle">Minimalist Light Pink Nail Designs</h3>
                                    <p class="content-text">Minimalist nail art continues to trend, and light pink provides the perfect canvas for understated elegance. Delicate line art, tiny floral decals, or geometric shapes add a touch of personality without being overly fussy.</p>
                                    <p class="content-text">Opt for neutral colors like white, black, or gold for the accents to maintain a sophisticated and chic look. A matte top coat can further enhance the minimalist aesthetic.</p>
                                    <ul class="content-bullets">
                                        <li>Use a fine-tipped brush for intricate details.</li>
                                        <li>Choose simple designs that complement the light pink base.</li>

                                    <p class="content-text">Applying nail polish neatly takes practice. Start with a thin base coat, followed by two thin coats of your chosen light pink polish. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next.</p>
                                    <p class="content-text">Finish with a top coat for added shine and protection. Clean up any smudges with a cotton swab dipped in nail polish remover for a professional-looking manicure.</p>
