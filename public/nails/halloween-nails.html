                                <p class="content-text">Simple Halloween nails can be just as effective as intricate designs. A single accent nail with a spooky design, or a solid color with a festive decal, can make a big impact. Minimalist designs are perfect for beginners or those short on time.
                                Try a classic French manicure with a Halloween twist, like orange tips or black and white stripes.  Simple polka dots or stripes can also create a festive look with minimal effort. Embrace negative space for a chic and easy Halloween nail design.</p>
