Non-acetone removers are gentler but may require more effort for darker or glitter polishes.  Choose acetone for speed, non-acetone for sensitive nails.</p>
                                    <p class="content-text">For Toronto residents, both acetone and non-acetone removers are readily available.  Weigh the pros and cons of each to determine what suits your nail care routine best.</p>

                                        <li>Non-Acetone: Gentler but may require more effort.</li>

                                    <h3 class="content-subtitle">Natural Nail Polish Remover Options</h3>
                                    <p class="content-text">Natural nail polish removers often utilize ingredients like soy-based solvents or ethyl acetate.  These are gentler alternatives to harsh chemicals, making them ideal for those with sensitive nails or seeking eco-friendly options in Toronto.</p>
