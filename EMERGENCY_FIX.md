# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX: Bypass Cloudflare Immediately

## Step 1: Bypass Cloudflare (Do This NOW)
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ bookbuy.ca
2. Click "DNS" tab
3. Find your domain record (Type: A, Name: @)
4. Click the **ORANGE CLOUD** icon next to it
5. Turn it **GRAY** (DNS only, no proxy)
6. Save changes

## Step 2: Test Your Site
- Your site should work immediately at bookbuy.ca
- All optimizations will be active
- No more SSL 525 errors

## Step 3: Deploy Netlify Changes
The netlify.toml changes need to be deployed:
1. Commit and push your changes
2. Netlify will auto-deploy
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

## Why This Works:
- Bypasses Cloudflare's SSL proxy
- Connects directly to Netlify
- All optimizations remain active
- No performance loss

## After Site is Working:
We can then fix Cloudflare SSL configuration properly.

**DO STEP 1 NOW - This will fix it immediately!**
